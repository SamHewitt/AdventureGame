                         You are a US jet fighter pilot flying over unchartered
                          territory searching for missing soldiers lost in this 
                       area 2 weeks earlier, you see 3 flashes below you. This might 
                       be the lost soldiers signalling S.O.S so you double back to
                        circle over the area and suddendly the jet have been hit by 
                              a blinding light from the forest below.
    

                         * Mayday Mayday We have been hit! I am going down *
                           Your jet starts spiralling down into the forest 
                             You pull the ejector seat and deploy your 
                           parachute. You watch the plane crashs into
                           the trees below. You see a clearing made by
                           the plane and aim towards it,You hit the 
                           ground, take off your parachute and take a 
                          look at your surroundings.You remember there
                          is a emergency kit at the plane so you head 
                                        in that direction.
 
       
                      You find the wreckage and salvage a water bottle
                      and a MRE. You take a look around you and realise
                      you are completely lost with no tracks in sight...
