Hello, my name is Relyrbe.

Heya, I’m Panestra.
When I was running from these monkeys one of the buggers 
snatched ma MP2000, if you happen to find it on you're 
travels you couldn’t get it back to me could ya? If you
can get it back to me i have a gift for you!

The names Jielete.
I was cutting up a bear when a ghost came along and chased me
into the forest, if you happen to find that damn bear can you
retrieve the knife out of it for me? it was an OKC-3S Knife.

(You could just find her a new one, I’m sure se won’t notice)

If you can get me my precious knife back i have something special for you!
